This question is easy in a sense that one could run an exhaustive iteration to obtain the result. That could work, except that it would run out of time when the input becomes too large. So let us take a step back to look at the problem, before rushing to the implementation.

Assume that the answer is kk, i.e. we've managed to complete kk rows of coins. These completed rows contain in total 1 + 2 + ... + k =k*(k+1)/2 coins
Instead of naive iteration, one could resort to another more efficient algorithm called binary search.
Time complexity : \mathcal{O}(\log N)O(logN).

Space complexity : \mathcal{O}(1)O(1).

"Always thought that binary search will only be used if there is "sorted " word involved in the question.
Amazed to see the way binary search is used to solve this problem.
very good question."
